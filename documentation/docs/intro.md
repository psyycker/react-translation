# Getting started

Let's talk about React Translation

## What is it

React Translation is a library for managing translations in *React*. <br/>
This library have been thought to be easier to use and to manage than other existing libraries
by allowing to split translation files and reduce the length of keys by using a namespace system. <br/>
<br/>
React Translation is also thought to work in the exact same way with React AND React Native! <br/>
No need to use two different libraries when you can only use one!


## Installation

To install the library, simple run

```shell
npm install --save @psyycker/react-translation
```
